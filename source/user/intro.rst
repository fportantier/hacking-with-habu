Philosophy
----------

Habu was developed with a few :pep:`20` idioms in mind.


#. Beautiful is better than ugly.
#. Explicit is better than implicit.
#. Simple is better than complex.
#. Complex is better than complicated.
#. Readability counts.

All contributions to Habu should keep these important rules in mind.
