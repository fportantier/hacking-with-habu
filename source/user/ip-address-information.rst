IP Address Information
======================

Now, if you have some IP addresses to check, you can use the habu.whois.ip:

::

   $ habu.whois.ip 8.8.4.4
   asn                      15169
   asn_registry             arin
   asn_cidr                 8.8.4.0/24
   asn_country_code         US
   asn_description          GOOGLE - Google LLC, US
   asn_date                 1992-12-01


Like with the habu.whois.domain command, you can output in JSON and CSV formats.

**Note:** The JSON output can contain additional information, so, check it if you see that
some important data is missing in the text/csv outputs.
